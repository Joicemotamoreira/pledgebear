          <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
          
          <p>Welcome to PledgeBear! We're building a platform to connect generous supporters like you with incredible groups, charities, and causes making a real difference. These Terms and Conditions explain the rules for using PledgeBear. By accessing or using our website and services, you agree to follow these rules. We've aimed to make them as easy to understand as possible, even the necessary legal parts.</p>
          <p>PledgeBear is operated by International Micro Payment Ventures Ltd, trading as Flip-Pay.</p>

          <h2>1. Your PledgeBear Account</h2>
          <p>To join PledgeBear and access all its features, you need to create an account. You must be at least 18 years old, or the legal age to enter into contracts in your location.</p>
          <p>When you register, please provide accurate and complete information. Choose a unique username that doesn't impersonate anyone or infringe on rights. You are responsible for keeping your account information and password secure and confidential. All activity under your account is your responsibility. If you suspect unauthorized use of your account, please notify us immediately at <a href="mailto:support@pledgebear.com">support@pledgebear.com</a>.</p>
          <p>We may ask for proof of age or identity if needed. Failure to provide accurate information or protect your account may lead to its suspension or termination.</p>

          <h2>2. Using PledgeBear Responsibly (Community Guidelines)</h2>
          <p>PledgeBear thrives on a positive and supportive community. To ensure a safe and effective environment for everyone, please agree not to:</p>
          <p><strong>Laws or Rights:</strong> Do not use PledgeBear for any illegal activity or in a way that infringes upon the rights of others.</p>
          <p><strong>Post False or Misleading Information:</strong> Be truthful in your profile, cause descriptions, and any content you share.</p>
          <p><strong>Offer Prohibited Activities or Items:</strong> Do not use PledgeBear to fundraise for or promote anything illegal, harmful, or inconsistent with our mission or Flip-Pay's policies.</p>

          <p><strong>Post Inappropriate Content:</strong> This includes content that is offensive, discriminatory, sexually explicit, or otherwise unsuitable for a platform supporting charitable causes.</p>
        
          <h2>3. Our Role and What We Don't Guarantee</h2>
          <p>PledgeBear provides the tools and platform for connections and support. However, please understand our limitations:</p>
          <p>PledgeBear (and Flip-Pay / International Micro Payment Ventures Ltd ) is not liable for any damages or losses you might experience from using our services.</p>
          <p>We do not mediate disputes between users or between users and third parties.</p>
          <p>We do not guarantee the success, legitimacy, or timely delivery of any project, initiative, or reward offered by a cause on PledgeBear. We do not endorse user-submitted content.</p>
          <p>Your use of PledgeBear and reliance on any content is at your own risk. You are solely responsible for any consequences.</p>

          <p>By using PledgeBear, you release PledgeBear and International Micro Payment Ventures Ltd from claims and demands related to disputes or your use of the services.</p>
          
          <h2>4. How Fees Work</h2>
          <p>Creating an account and a fundraising page on PledgeBear is free. When you receive financial support through the platform, PledgeBear will deduct a small transaction fee. These fees help us operate and improve the platform. The exact fees may depend on factors like location and payment method.</p>
          <p>Our payment processing partners are independent companies, and PledgeBear is not responsible for their services or any issues that may arise with payment processing.</p>
          <p>You are responsible for any applicable taxes or additional fees associated with your activity on PledgeBear.</p>
        
          <h2>5. External Links</h2>
          <p>PledgeBear may contain links to websites operated by third parties, such as the websites of the causes you support or their social media pages. We provide these links for convenience, but we do not control or endorse the content or practices of these external sites. Visiting linked websites is at your own risk.</p>
          <p>When you make or receive payments through PledgeBear, you are also agreeing to the terms of service of our third-party payment processors.</p>
        
          <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
          <p>PledgeBear's Rights: The PledgeBear platform, including its design, content (excluding user submissions), trademarks, and technology, is owned by International Micro Payment Ventures Ltd and is protected by intellectual property laws. You agree not to copy, modify, distribute, or create derivative works from our property without our permission. We grant you a limited, non-transferable right to use our content and user content solely for your use of PledgeBear in line with these terms.</p>
          <p>Your Content: You retain ownership of the content you create and post on PledgeBear (like cause descriptions, updates, images, etc.). By posting, you give PledgeBear and International Micro Payment Ventures Ltd a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license to use, display, and distribute your content to operate and promote the PledgeBear service.</p>
          <p>You are responsible for ensuring your content does not violate any third-party rights, including intellectual property rights. You agree to pay any royalties or fees related to your content.</p>
          <p>We are not responsible for the accuracy or legality of user-submitted content.</p>

          <h2>7. Closing Your Account</h2>
          <p>You can stop using PledgeBear and request your account deletion by contacting <a href="mailto:support@pledgebear.com">support@pledgebear.com</a>. We may keep some information as required by law or for our business records.</p>
          <p>Even after your account is closed, certain sections of these terms (like those related to content ownership, disclaimers, and indemnity) will still apply to your past use. If you have set up or are receiving recurring payments, deleting your account does not automatically cancel these. You must manage recurring payments separately through the platform's settings.</p>
          
          <h2>8. Indemnity (Protecting Us)</h2>
          <p>You agree to protect and hold harmless PledgeBear, International Micro Payment Ventures Ltd, and our affiliates, officers, directors, employees, and partners from any claims, liabilities, damages, and expenses (including legal fees) that arise from your violation of these Terms and Conditions, any law, or the rights of a third party. We reserve the right to manage the defense of any such claim, and you agree to cooperate with us.</p>
        
          <h2>9. Handling Disputes</h2>
          <p>If you have a concern or issue, please contact us first so we can try to resolve it informally.</p>
          <p>If a formal legal dispute arises, these Terms and Conditions will be governed by and interpreted under the laws of the Republic of Ireland, without applying its conflict of law principles.</p>

          <h2>10. Copyright</h2>
          <p>We respect copyright and expect our users to do the same. If you believe content on PledgeBear infringes your copyright, please notify us with the necessary information as required by applicable copyright law. We may remove content alleged to be infringing and may terminate accounts of users who repeatedly infringe copyright.</p>
        
          <h2>11. The Whole Agreement</h2>
          <p>These Terms and Conditions, along with our Privacy Policy and any other policies referenced herein, form the complete agreement between you and PledgeBear/International Micro Payment Ventures Ltd regarding your use of the service. They supersede any prior agreements.</p>
          <p>If any part of these terms is found to be invalid, the remaining parts will still be in effect. If we don't immediately enforce a right or provision, it doesn't mean we waive that right.</p>
          <p>We may modify or discontinue the PledgeBear service at any time. You agree that no third parties, other than International Micro Payment Ventures Ltd, are intended to benefit from these terms.</p>
          <p>Any claim related to PledgeBear must be brought within one (1) year after the cause of action arises, or it will be permanently barred.</p>
