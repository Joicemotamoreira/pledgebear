          <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
          <p>Your privacy is important to us at PledgeBear. We want you to feel confident and secure when using our platform to support or run campaigns for groups, charities, and causes. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your personal information.</p>
          <p>PledgeBear is operated by International Micro Payment Ventures Ltd.</p>

          <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
          <p>When you visit PledgeBear, we collect some basic, non-personally identifiable information that web browsers and servers typically provide, such as browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of your visit. We use this to understand how people use our site and improve it.</p>
          <p>For users who create accounts or engage in transactions, we collect potentially personally identifiable information, including IP addresses. If you create an account, we collect your chosen username and email address. If you make or receive payments, we collect necessary personal and financial information to process those transactions. This information is collected only as needed to provide the PledgeBear service.</p>

          <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
          <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
          <p>Operate and maintain PledgeBear, providing the services you access.</p>
          <p>Process transactions and manage payments for causes and supporters.</p>
          <p>Communicate with you about your account, updates, or new features.</p>
          <p>Monitor and analyze usage of the site to improve functionality and user experience.</p>
          <p>Ensure the security and integrity of the platform.</p>
          <p>Respond to your inquiries and support requests.</p>
          <p>Enforce our Terms and Conditions and other policies.</p>
          <p>We may use aggregated, non-personally identifiable information for reporting and analysis, such as publishing trends in platform usage.</p>

          <h2>3. Sharing Your Information</h2>
          <p>We share potentially personally identifiable and personally identifiable information only with our employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations (like International Micro Payment Ventures Ltd.) who need this information to process it on our behalf or provide services, and who have agreed to keep it confidential. Some of these parties may be located outside your home country; by using PledgeBear, you consent to this transfer.</p>
          <p>We do not rent or sell your potentially personally identifiable or personally identifiable information to anyone.</p>
          <p>We may disclose your information if required by law, such as in response to a subpoena, court order, or governmental request, or if we believe disclosure is necessary to protect the property or rights of PledgeBear, International Micro Payment Ventures Ltd., third parties, or the public.</p>
          <p>If you are a registered user, we may occasionally send you emails about PledgeBear updates, request feedback, or share news. If you send us a request, we may publish it to help us respond or support other users.</p>

          <h2>4. Payment Processing</h2>
          <p>To facilitate payments on PledgeBear, we work with third-party payment processors. When you make a payment, you provide your payment information directly to these processors. They provide us with limited information about your payment method (like a token, expiry date, card type, and last four digits) and, if you provide them, your name and email address.</p>
          <p>We also collect information about the support you give or receive, including the cause, amount, frequency, and any associated rewards.</p>
          <p>Your payment information handled by these processors is subject to their own privacy policies and terms of service.</p>

          <h2>5. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
          <p>We use cookies (small data files placed on your device) to help us identify and track visitors, understand their usage of PledgeBear, and remember their preferences.</p>
          <p><strong>Strictly Necessary Cookies:</strong> Essential for the website to function correctly, allowing you to log in and use core features. You cannot refuse these as they are necessary for providing the service.</p>
          <p><strong>Analytics/Performance Cookies:</strong> Help us understand how users interact with PledgeBear, allowing us to improve the website's performance and user experience. We may use third-party services like Google Analytics for this purpose. You can typically manage these through your browser settings or specific opt-out tools provided by the third party.</p>
          <p>You can set your browser to refuse cookies, but this may affect the functionality of certain features on PledgeBear. For more information about cookies, you can visit resources like All About Cookies.</p>

          <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
          <p>We take reasonable measures to protect your potentially personally identifiable and personally identifiable information from unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction. However, please be aware that no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. However, Pledge Bear is ISO27001:2022, SOC II - Type II, NIST CSF, GDPR and PCI-DSS 4 compliant. You can examine our accreditations here : https://trustcenter.flip-pay.com/</p>

          <h2>7. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
          <p><strong>Access and Update:</strong> You can access and update most of your account information through your profile settings on PledgeBear.</p>
          <p><strong>Deletion:</strong> You can request the deletion of your account and associated personal data by contacting us at [Insert PledgeBear Support Email Address]. We may retain some information as required by law or for legitimate business purposes.</p>
          <p><strong>Data Retrieval:</strong> If you have a regular account, you can contact our support team to request a compiled copy of your posted content. Please note that we do not provide data retrieval for accounts that have been banned for violating our policies.</p>
          <p><strong>Recurring Payments:</strong> Deleting your PledgeBear account does not automatically cancel any recurring support payments you have set up or are receiving. You must manage these subscriptions separately through the platform's settings.</p>

          <h2>8. Business Transfers</h2>
          <p>In the event that PledgeBear or substantially all of its assets are acquired, or if International Micro Payment Ventures Ltd. goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would likely be transferred to a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur and that any acquirer may continue to use your personal information as outlined in this policy.</p>

          <h2>9. Third-Party Advertisements</h2>
          <p>We do not run third-party advertisements on PledgeBear. If this changes in the future, this policy will be updated accordingly.</p>

          <h2>10. International Data Transfers</h2>
          <p>PledgeBear is operated by International Micro Payment Ventures Ltd., trading as Flip-Pay, based in Dublin, Ireland. If you are accessing our services from outside the European Union, your information may be transferred to and processed in Ireland and potentially other locations where our service providers operate. Data protection laws in these locations may differ from those in your country.</p>
          <p>Where we transfer personal data from the EU, we take steps to ensure it receives an adequate level of protection, often relying on mechanisms like Standard Contractual Clauses, to ensure your rights remain protected (in accordance with GDPR).</p>
          <p>By using PledgeBear and providing your information, you consent to the transfer and processing of your information in Ireland and globally as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

          <h2>11. Changes to This Policy</h2>
          <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any significant changes by posting the new policy on this page and, if you have an account, potentially through email or a notice on the platform. We encourage you to review this policy periodically. Your continued use of PledgeBear after any changes signifies your acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

          <h2>12. Other Applicable Terms</h2>
          <p>Your use of PledgeBear is also subject to our Terms and Conditions, available at [Link to PledgeBear Terms and Conditions]. By agreeing to this Privacy Policy, you also agree to the privacy policies of third-party services we integrate with, such as Google services (e.g., Google Sign-In, reCAPTCHA, Analytics), which can be found on Google's privacy page.</p>
